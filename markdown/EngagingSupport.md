# Engaging the Support Process

The support process for IBM Power Systems for Google Cloud starts with Google Support. For information, see [Getting Support for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/support/docs/).

## Open support cases with Google Cloud

To open a Google Cloud support case, follow the instructions in the [Case management](https://cloud.google.com/support/docs/role-based-support#case_management) topic. When you are completing the required files, select **Group Partner Support** and for the Component field select **IBM Power Systems For Google Cloud**.

Google engages IBM on behalf of the client as needed for investigating possible issues with the IBM Power Systems infrastructure. If the issue requires IBM input for a resolution, Google enables IBM to directly contact the client.

For cloud instance plans that include a license to run the AIX operating system, clients can choose to directly engage the IBM support team. In these cases, the problem should be with the AIX operating system, and not a problem with Google Cloud, the infrastructure, or the related VM lifecycle management services. Support is available for versions of the AIX operating system that are currently in standard support. AIX versions that are in extended support are not supported for the IBM Power Systems for Google Cloud service. For more information, see [AIX support lifecycle information](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1012517).

## Open support case with IBM

To directly engage IBM support, go to the [IBM Support portal](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/). Click **Open a case** and for the Product field, enter **AIX on Cloud**. You must use the IBM customer number that was provided during the subscription process for the IBM Power Systems for Google Cloud service. Complete all required information, and click **Submit Case**.
