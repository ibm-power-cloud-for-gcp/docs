# Overview
IBM Power Systems for Google Cloud is an infrastructure as a service offering from IBM and available from the Google Cloud Marketplace. This offer provides cloud instances running on IBM Power Systems servers with PowerVM. The service uses a monthly subscription model for cloud instance plans with different capacities of compute, memory, storage, and network.
Cloud plans provide a virtual network address space that is integrated into the VPC networks of the subscriber’s selected GCP project. Power virtual machine IP addresses are internal IPs within the subscriber’s project. Subscribers can use a command line tool or a web console to create and manage virtual machines (Power LPARs) in their cloud instance. Cloud plans include a license to run the AIX operating system. More details on the subscription process can be found at the "Learn more" link below
